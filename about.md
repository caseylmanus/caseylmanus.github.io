This is the personal github page for Casey Manus, I will use this page to showcase personal projects and talk about some of the things I am passionate about in technology, coding, etc.  I will also create pages for my ever growing list of open source projects and code snippets on Github that I am working on.

Here you will find topics on:

 <ul>
  <li>HTML5, Angular, React.js, Backbone, and Polymer.</li>
  <li>Mobile Development</li>
  <li>PhoneGap</li>
  <li>Scrum and Agile</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>The Go Language</li>
</ul>

I am also very **interested** in machine learning and data science so there will stuff about that, and whatever else strikes my fancy.
